        <p>Would you take an organ if you needed one? Nearly everyone would. But only 28% of us have joined the Organ Donor Register.</p><p>More than 10,000 people in the UK currently need a transplant. Of these, 1000 each year – that's three a day - will die waiting as there are not enough organs available.</p><p>Please help us to turn people’s good intentions about organ donation into action by registering on the <a href="http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/" target="_blank">NHS Organ Donor Register.</a></p>

        <p>Heather Morning, the MCofS mountain safety advisor, is urging mountaineers to register for the new service.  She said: "You can now contact the 999 emergency services by SMS text from your mobile phone. This is going to be particularly useful for those needing 999 assistance in the hills when mobile phone reception is often intermittent and there is not enough signal to make a call."</p><p>You must register for the service which you can do for free <a href="http://www.emergencysms.org.uk/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
