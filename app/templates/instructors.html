            <h4>Craig Borthwick</h4>
            <p>Venture Medical was established by Craig Borthwick to fill what he saw as a genuine gap in the first aid market - realistic first aid courses, fit for purpose and taught by people who knew first hand the skills needed to get by.</p>
            <p>A Police Officer for over twenty years, Craig had attended many first aid and emergency medical courses as a member of a specialist firearms intervention team, a rope access operative and latterly as a member of a busy Mountain Rescue Team where as well as being "on the hill" he performed a role as an assistant training officer.</p>
            <p>Gathering his instructing, teaching and CPD qualifications in an array of disciplines throughout the years, he began to specialise in the provision of medical assistance, firstly as a direct result of the requirements of NGB's and other outdoor and sports qualifications he held but latterly through developing a genuine interest in this specialist field.</p>
            <p>As a fully qualified and experienced multi-disciplined outdoors instructor Craig has led countless wilderness expeditions thought the UK and in Europe.</p>
            <p>Craig’s ethos at Venture Medical is the belief that it's important that anyone instructing our courses also currently practice the reality of providing medical aid. To that end you'll find that our instructors hone their personal first aid skills and practice what they preach, either through emergency services work or other voluntary services such as the Scottish Ambulance Service Community First Responders were Craig is an active volunteer and currently sits on the National Training Board review group for Scottish Emergency First Responders.</p>
            <p>This means our instructors are up to date professionals with a breadth of hands on experience sadly lacking from many first aid providers.</p>

            <h4>Phil Briggs</h4>
            <p>Born and raised in Yorkshire, where he first discovered his love of the outdoors, Phil joined the military at an early age and took off on his journey around the world.  During his time as a Royal Marines Commando and member of the UK Special Forces he was trained as both a combat and a patrol medic having to hone his skills in real life situations whilst on deployment and operating in some of the world’s most extreme and hostile environments.  After leaving the military, Phil moved to Scotland and completed several NGB qualifications in summer and winter mountain leadership and canoeing and white water coaching. He then went on to help develop a wilderness personal development programme working with young offenders and addressing their offending behaviour.  After a time in the outdoor industry and still with a keen desire to serve, Phil joined the police and subsequently the Strathclyde Police Mountain Rescue Team where he served for 9 years, continuing to utilise and develop his medic skills with both regular training and live call outs with the team.</p>
            <p>In recent years Phil has returned to the outdoor industry.  Still passionate about the role of wilderness expeditions in personal development, he now serves as operations manager for an outdoors charity providing carefully designed programmes to support and enable some of the most vulnerable and chaotic people in changing their lives and developing life skills.  Alongside this, he currently organises and leads extreme expeditions and charity treks throughout Scotland, the Gobi Desert, and the jungles and mountains of Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Phil has recently become a first aid trainer and is keen to pass on his vast knowledge and practical experience, suitable to a wide range of different industries, in order to make learning relevant, interesting and enjoyable.</p>
